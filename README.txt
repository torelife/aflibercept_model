0_input

The input model was generated from two crystal structures:
1.VEGFR2 domain 3 in complex with VEGF-A from PDB ID 3V2A
2. VEGFR3 domain 2 in complex with VEGF-A from PDB ID 1QTY

The initial orientation was generated by aligning VEGF-A from 
the two structures.


1_relax

The input structure was relaxed including optimizing the 
relative orientation between receptor and VEGF. We generated
100 relaxed structures.


2_remodel

The missing loop regions and the non-existing linker between the
two domains was modeled using Rosetta remodel. The regions were
specified to be loops and the correct sequence according to 
https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB08885 was provided in 
aflibercept.remodel. 
We generated 3 modeled structure based on each of the relaxed 
structures from the previous step generating a total of 300
models.
The best 20 models were selected based on the lowest Rosetta energy
and used as input for the next step.


3_relax_after_remodel

The remodeled structures were relaxed and the lowest energy 
model (Rosetta total_score) was used as the final model for analysis.

sub directories.
